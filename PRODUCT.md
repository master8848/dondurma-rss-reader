# Dondurma Product Guide

## Audience

Daily RSS/Atom readers valuing privacy, focus, offline access, predictable organization, and control over algorithmic discovery. UI supports English, Turkish, Spanish.

## Promise

No accounts, tracking, algorithmic timeline, or ads. Users choose sources, folders, filters, notification behavior, and reading appearance.

Success: users find, read, save, resume wanted articles without attention traps.

## Personality

Calm, capable, personal. Ice-cream identity adds warmth; functionality stays serious. Friendly utility, never noisy or childish.

## Product pillars

1. **Control:** user-defined feeds, folders, keywords, browser, sync, notifications.
2. **Focused reading:** clear hierarchy, comfortable typography, minimal chrome.
3. **Local-first privacy:** Hive storage; no account, analytics, advertising SDK.
4. **Resilience:** cache, conditional HTTP, background sync, recoverable feedback.
5. **Inclusive access:** EN/TR/ES, semantics, 48 dp targets, contrast, reduced motion, responsive widths.

## Design language

- Material 3, FlexColorScheme, Outfit typography.
- Rounded surfaces, restrained elevation, consistent spacing, clear primary action.
- Content leads. Decoration supports brand without competing.
- Toasts handle transient feedback; dialogs/sheets handle decisions and input.
- Wide layouts cap content width; phone layouts stay compact.

## Avoid

- Algorithmic recommendations, engagement loops, accounts, telemetry, ads, upsells
- Hidden destructive actions or ambiguous gestures
- Unlocalized UI strings or motion ignoring accessibility settings
- Dense enterprise-reader chrome

## Current boundary

Local-first feed reading. TTS, statistics, tags, external read-later services, advanced search, and reading queues remain backlog, not shipped features.

## Fork note (Prompt RSS)

This file describes the upstream Dondurma product pillars, preserved as-is.
The fork rebrands to **Prompt RSS** — a personal prompt-management app, forked
from Dondurma RSS Reader by
[DevOpen-io](https://github.com/DevOpen-io/dondurma-rss-reader)
(MIT © 2026 DevOpen; `lib/` and platform code still upstream). The prompt
direction (`library/` Markdown + Git + RSS distribution) is specified in
`PROMPTLIB_VISION.md`; planning docs live in
`/Volumes/hdd/saurav/code/promptlib/`. No product pillar above is modified by
this note.
